# Smart-Schematic
It is required to draw a schematic similar to the example below in a Python GUI. The GUI contains a dropdown list with the following items (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6). When the user selects M1, the text of M1a and M1b should recolored to red (or alternatively, the M1a and M2a transistors themselves can be recolored or highlighted), and so on for the remaining list items. Note that your program needs to be generic (can be applied to any circuit schematic in general).
